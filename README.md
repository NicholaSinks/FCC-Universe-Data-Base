This is my project for FreeCodeCamp's Relational Database Course Project 'Build a Celestial Bodies Database'.

All of it is contained in the sql file on this repo.

It has five tables: `galaxy | star | planet | moon | satellite`

some tables have more rows than others

each table has at least 5 columns.
